# CSE523-Machine-Learning-Code-in-Flux
Cricket is a very popular game it includes following types of players:
  1. Batsman
  2. Bowler 
  3. All Rounder
  4. Wicket keeper

Performance of a team depends highly upon performance of individual players and a player’s performance in each match depends on several parameters like location, past records, current form, average rate, strike rate (batsman), economy rate (bowler), number of innings, opposition team etc. So we are developing a model which could predict the best 11 players for that particular match.In this project we attempt to predict individual player’s performance in IPL, by analyzing their previous records through supervised learning and we rate every player’s performance through clustering.

Here are some screenshots of the output obtained:

  1. Clustering: K-means clustering 5 classes - 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5,10 ratings to the players
  
  Batsman Clustering:

  Bowler Clustering:

  All rounder clustering:

  2. Classification: Random Forest classifier was used
  3. Regression: We basically worked on improving accuracy using Regression. For improving the accuracy, we have used Hyper Parameter Tunimg. Here is a comparison chart for the same:
  4. Linear Programming: To finally get an optimised team from the playing 2 teams, we have used Linear Programming: Here's the output for Linear Programming:
