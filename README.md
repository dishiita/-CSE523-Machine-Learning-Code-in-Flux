Cricket is a very popular game it includes following types of players:
  1. Batsman
  2. Bowler 
  3. All Rounder
  4. Wicket keeper

Performance of a team depends highly upon performance of individual players and a player’s performance in each match depends on several parameters like location, past records, current form, average rate, strike rate (batsman), economy rate (bowler), number of innings, opposition team etc. So we are developing a model which could predict the best 11 players for that particular match.In this project we attempt to predict individual player’s performance in IPL, by analyzing their previous records through supervised learning and we rate every player’s performance through clustering.
